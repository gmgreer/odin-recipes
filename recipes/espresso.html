<h3>A decent Espresso</h3>
<p>Sadly a decent espresso is more dependant on how good your machine is. Those cheap $100 dollar machines at Wal-Mart or even those espresso knock off nepresso things just aren't capable of making a true espresso. They just can't produce the pressure or consistency of pressure needed to make a good espresso. So first thing do your research and buy a good espresso machine. For a quick video click <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7HIGdYy5of4&ab_channel=JamesHoffmann">here</a>. I really like this guys channel and his guides on coffee.  </p>
<p>Besides the right machine you just need freshness. Freshly roasted coffee beans, good filtered water. A good coffee grinder helps a lot here to get the fine grind you need for espresso.</p>
