<h3>Near Perfect Coffee</h3>
<p>This is not your grandma's coffee. That stuff in a big can that you have no idea when it was roasted. Honestly this is more of an essay on why you should be more picky with your coffee beans. Fresh is king. Fresh roasted, fresh ground, fresh water is a necessity</p>
<h3>Ingredients</h3>
<ul>
    <li>Fresh roasted whole bean coffee</li>
    <li>Filtered water</li>
    <li>Pour over coffee filter</li>
</ul>
<h3>Directions</h3>
<ol>
    <li>Grind beans to a medium grind, not too fine and a little coarse</li>
    <li>Heat water to about 206 degrees Farenheit. If you don't have a temperature gauge heat till boiling and let sit for 15 seconds after boiling stops.</li>
    <li>Add about two tablespoons of ground coffee per 8 oz of water.</li>
    <li>Using either a metal filter or a paper filter, experiment with what you like more. Pour water over ground coffee just to wet all of the coffee and let sit for a few seconds until all of the water is through.</li>
    <li>Evenly pour water over the coffee making sure it doesn't get too full. You want to be continuously pouring</li>
    <li>Enjoy!</li>
</ol>
